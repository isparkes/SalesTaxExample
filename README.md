# SalesTaxExample

This repository is intentionally more chatty that I would usually make it, so that you can see the way the example is put together.

Using the Git log, you can track the way that the application is created. Normally I would make a first initial commit when the basic
tests pass, and then develop features off the master branch for later merge. This seems a bit much for this example.
